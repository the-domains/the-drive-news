            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Koenigsegg's Regera Is the World's Most Endearing Instrument of Chaos</h1><p>When Koenigsegg pulled the cover off the Regera concept at last year's Geneva Motor Show, it seemed, well, insane. A 1,500-horsepower hybrid supercar with no conventional transmission? Seriously? Even autocorrect thought it was a bad idea. Try writing "regera" without capitalization. See what it turns into.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/42bd3dee02be0e69a2f319600bb3ef47433df301.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Behind The Scenes in Geneva With the All-New Aston Martin DB11</h1><p>It's new, it's gorgeous, it's turbo. It's an unbelievable moment. FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images The Aston Martin DB11 has a Quiet Start mode. Press and hold the red button and the V12 comes whirs to life with the exhaust valve closed, muffling its typical full-rev bark.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/00229d03e2a280fd051845c2706f6e2ee0c2be43.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Five Things You Could Buy Instead of a Jaguar F-Type SVR</h1><p>Jaguar officially unwrapped the F-Type SVR coupe and convertible this week, and while we already knew most of the salient details about it thanks to a recent leak,, it's still fun to salivate over the car's specs. A supercharged 5.0-liter V-8 cranked up to 575 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/322324529eef66034a8a5808a7f88245e7593946.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Faster, Nastier, Lightweight Pagani Huayra BC Revealed</h1><p>Pagani Automobili has revealed the latest iteration of its Huayra supercar, dubbed Huayra BC, somehow managing to find a new extreme out there on the bleeding edge. Like the standard car, the BC gets a twin-turbocharged V-12 powerplant sourced from AMG, with output climbing to 789 horsepower (an 8 percent bump) and 811 pound-feet of torque.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/33658e783130d3863defefc9a18f85ac132e4925.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Drive Joins Forces With DRIVE</h1><p>The launch of The Drive back in September was a Le Mans style free-for-all, a dozen writers and editors and car nuts sprinting from a borrowed conference room in Rockefeller Center to a dusty temp space on the Brooklyn waterfront.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The BMW M2 Will Save Us All</h1><p>Cheap. Fast. Fun. If you've been waiting for a true heir to the 2002ti's throne, it's here. BMW means never having to say you're sorry. But consider the new M2 coupe a bouquet of roses for enthusiasts who've felt jilted by a brand that's seemed distracted- even unfaithful, at times-to its Ultimate Driving Machine vows.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/61bfcf2ce26451d9eb2bc7508bcea904b5470f60.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The 2016 Volvo V90 is the long-since- leaked but nevertheless welcome wagon (see what we did there?) joining the XC90 SUV and S90 sedan atop Volvo's redrawn food chain.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5d96bb5bd442436bcf041dc28cd90a68c74f552c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Renault Alpine Vision Is France's Porsche Cayman Fighter</h1><p>Fast, French and-surprise-not blue. This is the Alpine Vision Concept, and it's the clearest message yet that Renault's new-old sub-brand is deadly serious about building performance cars. The Vision was unveiled Tuesday in Monaco, an evocative location for Alpine, a brand whose legend was all but forged in the Monte Carlo Rally.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d7e6a22b3ee839c04c1cdfc2bb0b1f7d76ff18dc.jpg"></article>]]></description>
