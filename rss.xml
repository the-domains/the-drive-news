My bleating, sputtering, wood-framed Morgan 3-wheeler has a soul.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The 2017 Bugatti Chiron Might Break Your Brain</h1><p>Existing superlatives cannot due justice to the insanity that is the 2017 Bugatti Chiron. So rather than try and confer how ridiculous this car is through clever compound adjectives like "fantastimad" or "bonkersanity," we'll let the car's spec sheet speak for itself: The Chiron has 1,480 horsepower and 1,180 pound-feet of torque.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a41df6bc796060cd5576284529548f0f328f857c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Koenigsegg announces plans...for a sedan.</h1><p>Christian von Koenigsegg has his sights locked square on Bugatti. If the Koenigsegg Regera he revealed directly across the hall from the Bugatti Chiron at the Geneva Motor Show isn't proof enough of that, ; his show floor declaration that his company is considering building a sedan certainly is.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/18e23317a404f12678231658d7944daa2c324c95.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Lamborghini Centenario LP770-4: Ferruccio's Birthday Present</h1><p>So instead, dearly departed Ferruccio-and the world-gets the-760 horsepower, 12-cylinder, mega-exclusive Lamborghini Centenario. It looks almost exactly the way we expected, based on the leaked patent renderings that surfaced last week. Which is to say, it's an orgy of sharp lines and creases jutting out in all kinds of pleasing ways, like the world's most impressive piece of origami.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d79adf4722824db4a0fa308d93d8f67c88ab0fe6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Koenigsegg's Regera Is the World's Most Endearing Instrument of Chaos</h1><p>When Koenigsegg pulled the cover off the Regera concept at last year's Geneva Motor Show, it seemed, well, insane. A 1,500-horsepower hybrid supercar with no conventional transmission? Seriously? Even autocorrect thought it was a bad idea. Try writing "regera" without capitalization. See what it turns into.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/42bd3dee02be0e69a2f319600bb3ef47433df301.jpg"></article>]]></description>
