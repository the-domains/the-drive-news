description: "So instead, dearly departed Ferruccio-and the world-gets the-760 horsepower, 12-cylinder, mega-exclusive Lamborghini Centenario. It looks almost exactly the way we expected, based on the leaked patent renderings that surfaced last week. Which is to say, it's an orgy of sharp lines and creases jutting out in all kinds of pleasing ways, like the world's most impressive piece of origami."
